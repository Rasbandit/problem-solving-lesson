* 80 20
  * coders spend 80 % of their time not coding

* We teach our students the syntax and soley how to repeat patterns
* we don't teach any of the prerequisite skills to being a good coder
* We assume an awful lot about the students coming in
  * we teach one day of formal problem solving in the last week week
  * we teach "debugging" in week 5
  * We spend 1 video on the software we use to code
  * We spend 1 video on algorithim thinking, and its more an intro that exists
  * We don't tech them how to use a computer
		* Simply put coding !== computer literacy
  * we don't focus on fast programming techniques (keyboard > mouse)
  * We don't go into the theory of programming and what problem it solves
  * We don't teach them how to plan effeciently
  * We don't teach error reading
    * this is really because they are not ready to plan for a project.
    * We give them 3 weeks to make a project and often mentors end up building way to much of it.

* As staff and mentors we often complain about the students and their ability code and debugg
  * we don't offer them the skills they need to be truly sucessful in these areas.
  * we tell them, learn to debug on your own, but never teach them.
    * Our current aproach to teaching them is to show them tools, but they don't have the mind to use it.
  * We built software to help the students keep up in lectures rather than teach them to use a computer.
  * We don't have the vocabulary to explain how the student is strugelling.

* In our current model really the only students who truly succeede are the ones who already learned these skills else where and we can truly build off of those.

* Async is a major issue for a few reasons.
  * the students who go to async have yet to figure out the reasoning and thinking part of coding
  * so instead of teaching them true fundamentals we just teach them the same material just "slower"
    * Really we just put them in a corner and tell them to practice and we hope things just click without a different approach.
* our stats show that async students do not have a solid job placement rate.

* As a mentor I spend most of my time asking the same questions to the students and I am finding their understanding is under what we hope for.
  * After PP we spend 2 weeks on "Advanced Topics" but all of it they are not allowed to use/not comfortable/applicable to their group projects
    * In the mentor interviews it is all too common to have students just flop during the debugging section and it shows they really have no understanding of the code.
      * And these are supposed to be the starts of the class.
      * Were really only producing around 2 students per cohort that I would even consider hiring
