# Reason

The most Pretensions lesson you will have about programming

## What is programming?

Before we can do that we need to answer 1 thing, what is Programming? Programing is a sub set of philosophy called Mathematical Logic. Mathematical logic is a subfield of Mathematics with the focus of exploring the idea of applying formal logic to a system or set of instructions.

ok ok in english please. Coding is learning to create a set of instructions using logical statements that produce a desired result. So to say i am programming my employees to do a task is technically accurate but not the same. The difference here is that we have to use a very formal language that does not allow for inference. If the system is bad, it is your fault.

## Programing as a Language

### Speaking Metaphorically

What we need to teach you before we can expect you to be competent coders is how to think and reason properly. You may think of yourself as someone who thinks logically or has good reason skills, but I promise you that your code will break you emotionally at least once before you really understand what logical reasoning looks and how to apply it.

I want to give you a thought experiment, what is a rule that we often give children to keep.

Example: Don't take candy from strangers.

There are so many loop holes here that it would take 1000 times longer to give a thorough explication of the rules and what we mean when we say just that. Try and think of a smart alec kid and how he would try and get around that rule. Its not hard.

The issue that we have here is that the way humans think and speak to each other is almost exclusively in shorthand. When we say things like "don't take candy from strangers" we really mean a myriad of things and we expect the other person to read between the lines and understand the underlying premise of what we are saying, and typically not what we are actually saying.

Remember when I said "smart alec kid" how many of you truly though I was referring to an actual kid named alec who is a kid and is smart. See, there are so many metaphor's in how we speak is really a miracle we can communicate at all.

The way we think ends up being the same, we have learned to take shortcuts around our thoughts so we don't have process every little thing. If I asked you to give me your house for free would you even consider it? Do you even remembering thinking:

well he wants my house, I paid for the house, so its mine and he has no right to ask for it, but He seems like a nice guy. He probably will take good care of it. I wonder if he would give me something in return. But this is probably a bad dea. I am going to say no.

You just said no. No second though. You are not equipped to think in this way, as a organic organism we have to think fast or we could die. You don't think when you are getting in a car crash, you act. It is this exact mechanism in your brain that is going to makes coding so hard.

lets take another example, is 3 close to 4. Some would argue its as close as it gets. Lets ask the computer. what does close mean? The computer does not even have a mechanism for close, that is vague term that is up to the individual to decide. How about this. is 3 within 2 units of 4. That is objective and is not left up to the individual to determine as it can be mathematically proven.

### Language Acquisition

It may seem odd at first that we refer to programing as a “Language,” but that is truly the best way to look at it. You are learning to communicate in an entirely new way, and I mean that very literally. But thinking about that in the traditional sense can still give the wrong impression of what I mean by saying new ‘language.’ When we learn a new spoken language one of the first things that you need to learn is that you can not translate things 'word for word', instead you must learn to translate 'meaning for meaning'. A great example of this idea is saying ‘You're Welcome’ in spanish. In spanish you say ‘de nada,’ which literally translates into ‘of nothing.’ Now 'of nothing' technically has meaning in english but it really doesn't communicate the same thing at all. Instead we must realize that we are translating the idea of gratitude, or thanks. This is what is meant by saying you must translate things meaning for meaning. Without an understanding of the culture and what the cultural phrases mean, translation would be impossible.

We see a similar issue in programming because the tasks we ask the computer to perform are technically using english words but the context of them are different and you can't do a direct translation. You need to read the code through a filter and translate what the code actually says into how a human would process it. So that means what would be a better way to say what you do is a computer translator. You are translating ideas that you have into a new language that the computer will understand. You have to learn the computers thought patterns and translate it from your brain to the computers 'brain.'

In english we structure our ideas in a specific way because that is how we have decided english should be spoken. But in other languages the structure of the sentence may be completely different. This makes speaking in the new language very difficult because not only are you having to worry about what does this word convey in the new language but where does this word fit in this sentence? For a sentence to make sense to the listener the words need to come in a specific order. (come up with examples of this later). Once you considering this it becomes apparent very quickly that learning to speak a new language requires more than just finding the equivalent word in the new language. You must learn to boil down the idea of what you are trying to convey/communicate and find a whole new sentence structure and the proper words to use. If you were to try and speak japanese using only literal translations it would make no sense to a native Japanese speaker.

When you are practicing your new language skills you are bound to make many mistakes in both pronunciation and grammar, but the saving grace about this is that we can usually rely on the listener to use enough reasoning, context and mastery of the language to figure out what is attempting to be communicated. Imagine if someone approached you and spoke with a very thick accent they said, “bathroom” you would know exactly what they were really asking. Can you show me where the nearest bathroom is. The only way you would be confused was if his accent we so thick you couldn’t even make out the word.

We rely so much on others ability to infer our meaning that to communicate with out it would take much longer as we would have to be so much more specific. But that is what computers require of us, to be more specific and more clear in a way that you probably didn't know existed.

## Philosophy

### what is logic?

So computers use the language of logic to operate. So what is logic exactly then?

Logic is: `Reasoning conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity.`

Logic is the process by which we can gain truth or knowledge using systems of thought often refered to Reasoning. There are many different types of reasoning and we will get to those but in its basic form, the purpose of logic is gain knowlege or often referred to as `truth` through statements of fact that lead to other statements of fact.

Believe it or not the word `Arguing` is synonymous with Logic. The root idea behind arguing is engaging in a discussion with another person to come to truth.

### Logic/arguing

So where does logic come from?

One of the fathers of logic is the ancient greek philosopher Socrates. He invented a method of arguing that we now call the "Socratic method."

```A form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions.```

The socratic method in its most basic description is what arguing, or debate is ment to be.

To argue is to engage two people in a discussion on a topic where both parties have difference in what they view to be "truth" and they set out to come to a conclusion of what is true, or to achieve knowlege. The goal of this can not to "win the argument" but again is learn. Your goal must be to align yourself with the truth, if your goal is to be right and you have a hard time backing down from an argument then Coding is going to knock you down and and keep kicking until you agree with it.

Ok but how does this apply to programming, its not like I am arguing with my computer. You are actually are. You need to see coding as and exchange between you and your computer. Its not a fight per say but you are asking the computer to do a task based on logic and if your logic is wrong it wont work, but more accurately it will do exactly what you typed, not what you want. Those are very different things. I am a good coder because I am good at arguing. I am not good at "winning" arguments, because that is not the point of arguing. its to come to truth, or understanding.

But still when arguing one party is right, and the other is wrong, and the point of arguing is determine the truth. The big change here is that you are always the one who is wrong in this debate between you and the code. This might feel like an attack on you and your intelligence or make it sound like you are stupid, but it really is not. The computer is the truest of arguers, pure logic. It knows nothing but the system, and you must learn to shape your mind to it, not its mind to yours. The computer will only ever try to do what you say, and when it says something that you didn't expect its because your mind is not in alignment with truth. The computer is 100% subservient to your designs, its just that you not very good at designing things just yet.

Theadore Roosavelt once said, "If I could be right 75% of the time I would reach the highest measure of my expectation."

Now when you first start to learn coding you will probably be right about 10% of the time. Until you learn how to align your mind to a computer you are going to feel friction. And this drives a normal person mad by this, and how do most arguments end where one person feels attacked? With swearing and yelling.

### Logic vs Emotion

So then, in a very broad sense there are two ways to argue. You can arguing from an emotional standpoint or argue from a logical standpoint. When we argue with people it is often somewhere on that spectrum with a mix of logical arguments and emotional arguments. Typically when people disagree and the discussion uses emotion as their basis we call it arguing, and when it is done with logic and reason we typically call it debating.

Sometimes when people debate it can turn into arguing for a number of reasons. We all have a friend(and maybe its you) that you know you can not argue with because it always will turn into a fight. In coding who do you think stays level headed and who do you think gets emotional.

A student codes out what they believe to be a "reasonable" statement of logic and no matter how much they try to make the computer understand, it does not agree. This same thing often happens with new coders and we as staff see it on a daily basis. We come to help a student and they have been arguing with the computer for a long time and the first thing they say is, "it should work but its doesn't! The computer is dumb!!!"

The issue is the student does not know how to argue with the computer, they don't know how to/realize they can get all the information they want out of the computer. The computer will answer any question you can give it, it will answer it without bias and always with the truth. But the hard part is the answers it gives is not in a clear cut answer. It is up to you the coder to use your reasoning skills/deduction skills to piece together a lot of information to come to a conclusion. Then once you have that, you can ask the computer is this true? and It will always tell you the answer. Now comes the fun part, learning how to reason and piece information together.

## Intro to Debugging

The average coder spends more time looking at their code than actually writing it. This is because we as humans are extremely error prone when we write code. Learning to decipher your code and figure out what is going wrong is in my opinion more difficult skill than coding itself. The cause of this is teaching how to write the syntax for code is easy... in theory, provided the human never makes a mistake and also thinks and reasons just like a computer. But this is not the case obviously so we are left with two minds trying to reason with each other where one reasons with emotion, and the other reasons with logic. We teach you things like, this is how you write a function, this is how you write a for loop. All we do is give you the tool that you can use. Its up to you to know how to string them all together. But by teaching you in this way really what we are doing is giving you just enough information to be dangerous. If you have not learned the skills to reason about your code and think logically through what is actually happening then you will be lost.

All students I have worked with at one time or another have fallen into this big hole that I call, `Working with what you want, now with what you have.` I go to help a student who is stuck and without fail I ask them, what data type is this, or what is the value of x, and they don't know. So they are coding, with no concept of what is actually going on and no attempt to clarify it either. What My goal from here on out is to give you to tools and processes to identify what the reality of your code is doing, so you can sherlock holmes your code.

### Listening to your code

Any time your code fails to run or creates an error, it will always give you an error log in your console. What that error is, is the computer telling you exactly what happened, and where the error occurred. Seems like a pretty sweet deal huh? Sounds like it, until you actually read the error and at that point most new programmers "read" the error then ignore it and debug a totally unrelated section of their code. Or fairly often students never even read the errors and again, work with their assumptions on what they think the error is. To continue the idea that learning to code is learning to argue, ignoring the errors is the equivalent of not listening to what the other person has to say. One big reason for this is because the error comes back as red. Your brain has been programmed by society to avoid red, especially red text. It can even invoke a sense of anxiety because the red text is basically yelling at you saying you messed up! Try again. But that is not the case. It is trying to get your attention and inform you of where the error happened, look at is as helpful red text, not hateful red text.

Again we see this often where a student will read an error then go down a completely unrelated rabbit hole. That is about the same thing as not addressing what the other person is saying, and in a real argument the person would correct them and make they stay on track, not the computer though. It will humor you in any conversation you want, even if it doesn't pertain to the issue at hand. It will only do what you want.

The reason your mentors rose above their peers and got hired on as mentors is primarily because they know how to read errors, not because they don't make them. When a mentor comes to help you with your code they will almost always look first at the error log and use that information to start their investigation. The reason your mentors are good debuggers is because they take the time to listen to the code, they don't come in with presumptions, they will listen, ask questions and form conclusions based off of the information the computer is giving them. They are masters at asking questions that pertain to the errors they are reading.

Now I make it sound easy to read errors, and I am not saying that it is. But I am saying is that going through the pain of errors and what they are telling you is worth it. If you leave DevMountain and can't read what the errors are telling you then your growth as a developer will be stunted.

### Character by Character, not Word for Word

Earlier we talked about the idea of `close to` or `similar` and how computers don't have a concept of that. so if i ask you what am I spelling here what would you say.
```
helo
```
You would probably guess `hello.` Now how does a computer so that? Thats not a word. Period. How many of you make types when you write code? All of you. If you have been coding for any amount of time you have probably made a typo that took you an uncomfortably long amount of time to find. How many of you felt demoralized by this. `Man I made such a small mistake, how could I be so stupid?!` You might also think, how can such a "small" error break so much. First let me say the computer does not make the distinction of error "size". An error is an error. 

First let me encourage you a bit by telling you that, it never goes away. It is not a reflection of your intelligence and you are normal for making that mistake. But the longer you code the less you will make the error and the faster you will be at it. What you will need to learn is how to stop yourself from "reading" in the traditional sense and start looking at your code as an assortment or letters, instead of words. Words imply meaning and connection. But allow me to show you why that may not always be a good idea.

```javascript
var name = 52;
var age = 'Bob ross'
```

Just because the variable names are age does not mean there is any kind of restriction of what we can put in there. It would make sense to swap the two variables to have it make "sense," but don't get confused, we are not doing that for the computers sake, it has no idea what name even is.

The problem here is another issue with human thinking and computer thinking. To the computer it does not look over the code and how you named your variables and determine if it makes sense. it couldn't care less what you named any variable or any function, thats not its job it just executes your logic, we just named things for our convenience. its because of this that a typo can halt the whole program from running because it literally can't even remotely guess what you "intended" for your code. Its because of this you need to learn to read/write in a specific way.

We name variables what we do so when you read our code 1 week from now we can guess as to what it is doing. We also do this so that other coding can do the same. Most of the reason we write code the way we do is not for the computer its for our future self and co-workers. Let me give you few examples of code to illustrate.

All the examples of code work exactly the same, they all run just as fast, they all make equal amount of sense to the computer, so which one is best?

#### functions that removes specific number from array

``` javascript
function itemRemover(arrayToModify, itemToRemove) {
  for(var index = 0; i < arrayToModify.length; i++) {
    if(arrayToModify[i] === itemToRemove) {
      arrayToModify.splice(i, 1);
    }
  }
  return arrayToModify
}

function iteRemver(arrrayToModify, itemTORemve) {
  for(var dex = 0; dex < arrrayToModify.length; dex++) {
    if(arrrayToModify[dex] === itemTORemve) {
      arrrayToModify.splice(dex, 1);
    }
  }
  return arrrayToModify
}

function goosePlucker(goose, feather) {
  for(var featherCount = 0; i < goose.length; featherCount++) {
    if(goose[featherCount] === feather) {
      goose.splice(featherCount, 1);
    }
  }
  return goose
}

function bobRoss(egypt, xkcd) {
  for(var cottage = 0; cottage < egypt.length; cottage++) {
    if(egypt[cottage] === xkcd) {
      egypt.splice(cottage, 1);
    }
  }
  return egypt
}

function a(b, c) {
  for(var d = 0; d < b.length; d++) {
    if(b[d] === c) {
      b.splice(d, 1);
    }
  }
  return b
}
```

So when you are debugging your code, it is often a good idea not to assume anything is spelt write. Learn to read each variable one letter at a time, and not words at a time. Because the words will be missleading and your brain has purposefully developed auto correct on text to make life easier. Try to turn that off.

## Reasoning

### Console.log fu

The most simple and strait forward tool any programming language has to determine the truth of the situation is the console.log. At any time and any moment anywhere in our code we can ask the code what exactly is happening with any line and it will 100% of the time tell us. That is the power of the console.log. With great power comes great responsibility. Just knowing what x is at any given time is nice and all but learning to interpret the results is the hard part.

### Scientific Method

Learning to use the console.log properly is what we referred to earlier as the "Socratic Method"

```A form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions.```

The goal of this is again, to come to truth or knowlege. The most formalized way that we can do this is through the `Scientific Method.` The scientific method gives all the tools and a framework to think in that helps us solve any problem we ran into with code.

Whoah, I thought I was signing up to be a programmer not a detective/scientist, why are we using those terms. First I need to explain what true `science` is.

Science is: 
```
The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.
```

Let me put this in a more english way. Science is the process of discovery. So what you normally think of science, like Bill Nye and "science experiments" are not true science. They already knew the answer when conducting the "experiments." They are reliving other discoveries and calling it science. So in coding when we have a problem we need to determine why the problem happened so we can fix it. The only way to do this is to experiment, come to conclusions, and perform new experiments based off of our previous conclusions.

1: Observation
3: Form Theory
4: Experiment
5: Analysis
6: Conclusion

Examples

Initial definition:
A number is any numerical value.

Question:
is 2 a number?
is '2' a number?

New Definition:
A number is any value you can do math on.

Question:
does 'Bob' + ' Ross' give us a number, or is 'Bob' or 'Ross' a number?

New Definition:
A number is any value you can do do math on and get a numerical value out.

Question:
does '2' + '2' give us a number?

new Definition:
A number is any value you can do do mathematical values on that return a unit and not a character that represents a number.

This process gets a lot more difficult as we continue to use more and more complex. But all of coding is using this process to establish small pieces of truth and to string them together with other pieces to make a more complicated system.

What ends up happening in the real world especially with new programmers is their head is full off assumptions and guesses and they attempt to string together 4 or 5 things together but when it comes to run time they are totally lost in what happened. They have not taken the time to check their understanding.

### Argumentative Structures

An argument is made up of two parts, premises and conclusions. The hope is that you have true premises (or assumptions) that should lead you to a conclusion. For example.

```premise 1: All humans are mortal
premise 2: Todd is a human
Conclusion: Todd is a mortal```

This is a valid structure for an argument because we could swap out any name on the conclusion and it stays true. Notice the difference between valid and truth. Lets see a code example to go with that

Idea: I can use variables to access items from an array

```javascript
var array = ['Todd', 'Bob', 'Richard', 'Tim'];
var number = 1;

presumption: array[1] === 'Bob'
presumption: number === 1
conclusion: array[number] === 'Bob'
```

Using only a few lines of code we are able to deduce, that we can use variables in place of a literal number to access items from an array.

But how would this actually use this in code. lets convert this over to actually code and the tool we have to check out premises and our conclusion


```javascript
var array = ['Todd', 'Bob', 'Richard', 'Tim'];
var number = 1;

console.log(array[1] === 'Bob') // true
console.log(number === 1) // true
console.log(array[number] === 'Bob') //true
```

When we argue with other humans it can be tough to know who is right when judging weather a premise or conclusion is correct or not, hence why the argument can take a while or even stall. But with the computer that is not an option. If you think you are right and the computer disagrees..... then you are wrong. No amount of persuasion will change that.

When you run into bugs or errors in your code it is 99% your fault. There is no shame or dishonor in this

### What is a single action?
