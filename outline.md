# Problem Solving

## What is it Problem Solving?

- Problem solving is a "Meta Skill"
  - Its a skill that exists is most skills but the process is similar to all fields.
- Problem solving is has a process and method to it.
  - Method: a particular form of procedure for accomplishing or approaching something, especially a systematic or established one.
  - A systematic approach to solving a problem. Most new coders use this as their problem solving method.
    1. Try a solution.
    2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
    3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out or give up.
  - By the definition of a method this is technically a process to problem solving, but is it effective? 

“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.

Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.

Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report)

V Anton Spraul, The author of "Think Like A programer: an introduction to creative problem solving" is one of the better teachers when it comes to teaching an introduction to programming. He says this in regards to programming.

“The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul

## Algorithms

- When learning to code and solve problems, coding should be the easy part.
  - WHAT?!?!? Are you stupid?! Don't make me feel bad, Coding is hard!
    - Yes coding is hard but often times what you are stuck on has nothing to do with code.
  - Coding is the process of telling the computer what steps to take to solve the problem.
  - You don't code solutions, you code algorithms.
    - Coding a solution would make your programs static and unhelpful, you already know the answer so why bother coding it?

### So what is an algorithm then?

- Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.
- What this means to us is we need to learn to develop a system for solving the problem at any scale.
- Before you even consider coding you need to think the question through, do you know how to solve this problem outside of code?
  - Pagination, what if I asked you to display 24 items on a page. Don't design your algorithm to only handle 24, what if we change it to 50, 100, 2.
  - Your goal is to make a system to handle all possible input combinations.
- Think about math, your teacher taught you how to solve a problem, here is the rules you can follow and the steps you can take to get to a solution.
- What your goal is when problem solving, is not to come to the solution for your specific problem, but to come up with an algorithm that can solve the same problem but with different inputs.
- This should start to sound like a function.
  - Functions are not a programming thing, it is actually a concept taken from mathematics.
  - Its a way to take a process and assign it a name and to say, if it is given these inputs, it will have these outputs.
  - Functions in its most basic form, is a way to take in inputs, and to give an output, and given the same input it will always return the same things.
  - Functions by design should do a very specific task, and they can be chained together to finish a bigger task.

## Logic and Math

- Coding is based off of 'Mathematical Logic.'
- Most coding problems can be solved using the basic math operators but not always.
  - Depending on what field you go into the amount of math you need to know will vary.
  - How ever it will always make a a better coding if you know math.
    - Knowing math can teach you shortcuts that you would have no idea about.
