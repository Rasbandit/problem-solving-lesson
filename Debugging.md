# Debugging/arguing

you always have as much info as the mentor does

## Tripartite soul

- rational | logical
  - Seeks truth and is swayed by facts and arguments (essence of a computer)
- Spirited | Emotional
  - how feelings fuel your actions (getting offended by code)
- Appetititve | Physical
  - eat, sleep, reproduce

## Arguing

- I am good at coding, because I am a good arguer/debater.
  - arguing is not winning, it means you are good at listening and forming coherent statements

- be careful not to answer question's that are not being asked.

- The problem with coding is that you are always in the wrong, you must learn to align yourself to the code

## Logical thoughts

There is a town where all men must be clean shaven. There is one barber shop with two rules

- 1. Barber must shave all men who do not shave themselves.
- 2. Barber must not shave any man who does shave himself.

"All men who shave themselves has to include, every guy who shaves himself, including the barber."

## Inference

### Concept

- The word logical comes from the greek word meaning `"The Word"` or `"What is Spoken"` but has come to mean, "reason" or "thought".


### Human Inference

- studied by cognitive psychologist.
- AI research is trying to teach a computer to make human inferences.

#### Socratic method to personal learning (arguing)

- A way to discover truth

- Step 1: Initial definition
- Step 2: question that brings up exception
- Step 3: new definition 

- You must be able to continue to give a more thorough answer/definition until no more questions arise
- What is a fish?
- does that cover all examples?

is 2 a number?
is '2' a number?
is {} a number?

- You can not have knowledge until you can give a definition of something that can exclude all instances of not what ever you are describing

Interlocuturs: people participating in a dialogue debate or conversation.

Computer always provide the counter argument.

This Method is not about making a winner and a looser, it creates truth.

## Argumentative structures

validity != truth (yes, no, mu)

### Deduction (patrick so this must be true meme)
Entailment: if a is true, b must follow. A necessarily leads to b.

If your premise are true then your conclusion must be true

if a + b = d
and b + c = d
then a === c

Arguments can be proven invalid if you can give an example of when the conclusion is false based off those premises.

#### Valid argument

premise 1: All humans are mortal
premise 2: Todd is a human
Conclusion: Todd is a mortal

#### Invalid

Premise 1: All cats are mammals.
Premise 2: Im a mammal.
Conclusion: I am a cat

#### Invalid argument

premise 1: All humans are mortal
premise 2: Todd is a human
Conclusion: Joe is Todd's coworker

#### Valid???

premise 1: All humans have tails
premise 2: my brother andrew is a human
conclusion: he has a tail

### Induction

Using Past Experience to make future predictions.

Needing to rule out what can't be true, so you can establish what is true.

Inductive arguments prove that the outcome is likely to be true.


#### example

Premise 1: most men in ancient athens had beards
premise 2: socrates was a man who lived in ancient athens
conslusion: Therefor socrates probably had a beard

#### Odd example (I guess meme)

there is a substance called Grue: that is the color green before a certain time, called T.
T could be any time in the future.
So emeralds are grue because it could be before time T.
so therefor emeralds will be blue before time T.

### Abduction (doctor/detective)

Drawing A conclusion based on the explication that best explains a state of events, rather than from evidence provided by the premises.

Basically, coming to a conclusion based on the evidence provided.

(process of elimination)
our goal is to remove what is not true and look for what is most likely.
"When you have eliminated the impossible, what ever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
sherlock holmes

#### Example

##### One

Ana Bray told you she failed her physics midterm.
Ana hasn't been in physics class since your reacher graded the exams.
Ana has been in sociology class which meets right after physics.

Ana Dropped Physics

##### Two

You and your roommate ate sushi last night.
you both woke up with violent stomach aches.

You and your roommate ate some bad sushi.

#### Bad
